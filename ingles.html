                <h3>Do you know what heat islands are?</h3>
                <p>Heat islands are urban areas that experience significantly higher temperatures than surrounding rural
                    areas, due to urbanization and lack of vegetation.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box2">
                <h3>What are the causes?</h3>
                <p>Heat islands are caused by the absorption of heat by surfaces such as concrete and asphalt, in
                    addition to the lack of green areas and the emission of heat from vehicles and buildings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="box3">
                <h3>How to combat the effect?</h3>
                <p>Our goal is to create an automated and intelligent system that monitors, analyzes and implements
                    effective solutions to reduce the impact of heat islands in cities.</p>

                <h3>1. AI Data Monitoring and Analysis Platform</h3>
                <p>IoT sensors collect real-time weather data, analyzed by AI to identify affected areas and predict
                    heat spikes. The system automatically adjusts the use of resources such as irrigation and cooling.

                <p>Green roofs with automated irrigation use soil and climate sensors. AI algorithms select optimal
                    plants to optimize cooling and water efficiency.</p>

                <p>Thermoregulating floors reflect sunlight like in Los Angeles, reducing heat absorption. Sensors
                    monitor temperature, adjusting materials as needed, with automated maintenance.</p>

                <p>The consequences of heat islands are local and global. Locally, they affect the quality of life,
                    increasing temperatures and causing health problems. Globally, they contribute to climate change and
                    intensifying extreme events such as droughts and storms.</p>
